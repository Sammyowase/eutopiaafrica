✨ “Only a Few Schools Will Host this Magic.”

Christmas wish party isn’t for everyone. We’re creating a new Christmas tradition — and only a few selected universities will be allowed to host it this December.

Slots are extremely limited. Once we finalize approvals, the list closes — and the spotlight shifts elsewhere.

Hosting means:
🎥 National buzz
🚀 Students posting, trending
👑 Prestige as a values + fun campus

CTA Button:
🎓 “Claim Your Spot
[9/15/2025 3:47 PM] P Tosbabe: 🎁 “Not Every Brand Gets Into the Claw Machine.”

Thousands of students. Pajamas. Fireworks. Cameras flashing.
And in the middle of it all — your product, in their hands, in their posts, in their hostels.

This isn’t ordinary sponsorship. It’s direct access to Gen Z hearts — the buyers of today and tomorrow.

👉 Here’s the magic:
	•	Students live together in hostels. If your product slaps, it spreads like wildfire. One student = hundreds of new customers.
	•	Your brand doesn’t just get seen — it becomes part of the conversation, the hype, the clout.

⚡ Rules of the game:
	•	Only 2 brands per category, per school.
	•	Once a slot is gone, it’s gone.
	•	Competition is fierce
       .     Getting picked is a privilege, not a guarantee.
