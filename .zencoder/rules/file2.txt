**Content**:
```
Christmas wish party isn't for everyone. We're creating a new Christmas 
tradition — and only a few selected universities will be allowed to host 
it this December.

Slots are extremely limited. Once we finalize approvals, the list closes 
— and the spotlight shifts elsewhere.

Hosting means:
🎥 National buzz
🚀 Students posting, trending  
👑 Prestige as a values + fun campus
```

**CTA**: [🎓 Claim Your Spot]

### For Sponsors Page
**Headline**: "Not Every Brand Gets Into the Claw Machine. 🎁"

**Content**:
```
Thousands of students. Pajamas. Fireworks. Cameras flashing.
And in the middle of it all — your product, in their hands, in their posts, 
in their hostels.

This isn't ordinary sponsorship. It's direct access to Gen Z hearts — 
the buyers of today and tomorrow.

👉 Here's the magic:
• Students live together in hostels. If your product slaps, it spreads like wildfire
• Your brand becomes part of the conversation, the hype, the clout

⚡ Rules of the game:
• Only 2 brands per category, per school
• Once a slot is gone, it's gone  
• Getting picked is a privilege, not a guarantee

Categories:
💍 Jewelry & Accessories | 👟 Sneakers & Streetwear | 💄 Beauty & Skincare
📱 Tech & Gadgets | 🥤 Food & Drinks
```
